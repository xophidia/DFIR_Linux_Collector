Stand-alone collecting tools for Gnu/Linux
- Very low impact on the host
- No use of host binaries (anti hooking)
  - all binaries are included in the executable
- Export in json format (log) / raw (dump ram) and Text format
- Dump ram with avml (ref to compatilibilty https://github.com/microsoft/avml#tested-distributions)
- The result is a compressed archive
